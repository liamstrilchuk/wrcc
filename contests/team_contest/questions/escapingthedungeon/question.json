The dungeon consists of multiple rooms, with some paths connecting them. Paths are all one-way, going from the first to second rooms. Each room has an id, a string of between one and three lowercase letters. Your mission is to determine how many rooms eventually lead to the exit.",
	"input": "The first line of input consists of an integer, n, and the start and end room ids. n is the number of paths (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the following n lines of input each consist of two room ids. ",
