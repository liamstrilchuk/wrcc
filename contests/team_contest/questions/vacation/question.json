Your task is to create an algorithm to determine the cheapest route. You are only willing to spend a certain amount of time on planes and have a maximum number of flights.",
	"input": "The first line of input consists of five integers: a (0 ≤ a ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>), the starting position; b (0 ≤ b ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>), the target destination; n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of available flights; j (0 ≤ j ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>), the maximum time spent on planes in total; and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2000), the maximum number of flights you are willing to have. The next n lines consist of four integers: the starting point, the destination, the cost, and the duration in minutes.",
