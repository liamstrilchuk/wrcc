The door says that it needs a password, but fortunately you helped to design this type of door, so you know what a valid password looks like:<ul><li>The first ten characters are letters (all lowercase). In a valid password, there is exactly one letter that repeats three times in a row, and exactly one letter that repeats two times in a row. No other letters repeat more than once in a row. In a valid password, no letter repeats four or more times in a row.</li><li>The next character is the last digit (the ones digit) of the sum of the previous letters. For example, if the letters are \"abcdefghij\", the sum will be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55, so the checksum digit will be 5.</li></ul>",
