	"content": "You’ve been hired to demolish some ancient buildings in a city. To do this as fast as possible, you use your area detonator to detonate a small square of buildings.<br><br>The city is a square grid that contains empty tiles or buildings. Your detonator can be configured to detonate any area on the grid as long as said area is a square whose side length is between 3 and 10 squares, inclusive.<br><br>However, arming the detonator with enough explosive to capture a larger area will cost more, so you want to make your one chance at detonating as efficiently as possible. The cost to detonate a square with side length s is s<sup>2</sup>. The efficiency of any detonation is equal to the number of buildings divided by the cost.",
	"input": "The first line of input consists of two integers: the side length of the city, n (3 ≤ n ≤ 15), and the number of buildings b (1 ≤ b ≤ 225). The next b lines contain two integers each: the x and y coordinates of each building (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n).",
	"output": "Output three space-separated integers: the x and y coordinates of the top left corner of the most efficient detonation followed by the side length of the detonation.",
