	"content": "You've been assigned a number of math problems by your teacher. However, they're pretty hard and you don't want to do them! Instead, you create a program to solve the problems for you. There are a few new operations in your homework:<ul><li>< means to take the first number, divide it by two, and multiply it by three times the second number. For example, 5<6 = 2.5*18 = 45.</li><li>> means to take the first number, add 6, and divide it by the second number. For example, 5>6 = 11/6.</li><li>~ means to take the square of the first number, and add the second number. For example, 5~6 = 25+6 = 31.</li></ul>For each operation, after computing the result, round down to the nearest integer (so 11/6 would become 1). All of these operations have the same precedence (order of operations).",
