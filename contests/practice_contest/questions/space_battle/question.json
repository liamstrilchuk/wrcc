You must determine how to destroy as many enemy ships as possible.<br>Each ship has a health, damage, and weapons reload time. A ship is destroyed when its health reaches zero. Assume that your weapons recharge before each battle, and that both ships fire immediately when a battle starts. ",
	"input": "The first line of input consists of four integers, t, h, d, and r. t is the number of enemy spaceships (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), h is your ship's health, d is your ship's damage, and r is your ship's reload time in seconds (1 ≤ h ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ r ≤ 100). The following t lines each consist of three integers: the enemy ship's health, damage, and reload time respectively.",
